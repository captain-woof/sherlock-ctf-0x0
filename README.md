# Sherlock x Secureum CTF

## Introduction

This is a clone of the [Sherlock CTF repo](https://github.com/sherlock-protocol/sherlock-ctf-0x0), with my solutions in each challenge folder.

Original description:

> 32 participants selected from Secureum bootcamp were locked in a 7-day battle to hack each otherâ€™s contracts.

> The top 32 performers on the Secureum bootcamp quiz were selected to participate in a unique kind of blockchain CTF. Each participant created a contract that is possible but VERY difficult to hack. Over the course of the 7 days, each participant tried to hack as many of their fellow students' contracts as possible.

> Each participant started with a maximum of 8 points (depending on the completeness of their submission). A participant earns 1 point for each contract they are able to hack. Extra points were awarded for creative and unintended hacks of others' contracts. (see `EXTRA.md`)

> Check `solves.json` too see how many time each challenge was solved during the contest.
