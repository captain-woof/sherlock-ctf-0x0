# CTF Submission: Haunted Dungeon

Welcome to the **Haunted Dungeon**.
Will you be able to conquer its treasure or will you perish?

The Haunted Dungeon is a "turn-based" RPG with 5 floors. The 6th floor is the treasure room.
There is a store with power up items and each floor is guarded by a monster.
There's a limited amount of times one can enter the store in a floor.
The monster's health and attack are pseudo-random.
Pay close attention to the contract's log, since it displays in-game messages.

Some items purely icnrease your stats while others may increase some stats while decreasing others...

The CTF is deemed as completed once you conquer all floors and claim the treasure!

Have fun!
